title: Chocolates from This Other Box of Chocolates
description: Due to popular demand (both hosts) we consume another box of chocolates on air. Is this the worst podcast idea we've had? How is this a series? Why hasn't [company name withheld] sponsored this podcast? Ponder these questions and more and you listen to half an hour of chewing sounds. Happy Halloween!
