  list:
    - Have a schedule and routine
    - Keep the room dark and the bedtime routine soothing and low-key, calming, comforting
    - Be sure baby is clean and swaddled before nursing back to sleep
    - Keep night and day very distinct
    - Keep baby well fed during the day
    - Once you start a sleep training routine, stick with it at least four days
    - If baby wakes up screaming, give them a chance to self-soothe
    - Track how long baby has been awake and watch for sleepy cues
    - Don't let daytime naps go over 2Â½ hours, and don't start them after 5:00, 4:30 if child is older than 9 months.
    - Introduce a small stuffed animal
