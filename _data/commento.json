As a writer, I haven't been putting forth effort regularly, and I go in spurts - some times I will write on a normal basis, and then I'll go months without writing!  So, I made a resolution to write something every day - whether its a page, a paragraph, some poetry, or even a blogspot.  So far, I'm doing ok, but not 100%.  Hopefully by the end of January I will be doing it EVERY single day.\n\nThanks for sharing your goals on this episode!","html":"","parentHex":"root","score":0,"state":"approved","creationDate":"2019-01-23T01:15:51Z","direction":0,"deleted":false},{"commentHex":"265630895fd0497902328eb6f149974c0b147877b4b9a95ccec4348ece33f6fe","domain":"tto.koser.us","url":"/episodes/030-animated-movie-characters","commenterHex":"9756ab26b02fecb59fd732a78677cf03896b732d05c1a0b9cb612ebdaa751186","markdown":"Hubie 😆 ","html":"","parentHex":"root","score":0,"state":"approved","creationDate":"2017-03-17T22:00:38Z","direction":0,"deleted":false},{"commentHex":"5f1f171f581d0f6c663674574501bf96d5b8fd9ad0d321b982f2cf7bb717d339","domain":"tto.koser.us","url":"/episodes/091-twilight-zone-episodes","commenterHex":"6c1bd0b526e8868f38492605a30d07abc976228bb36db664a7d61305c0f142e9","markdown":"Another great episode!  \nI liked hearing the synopsis's of the shows, and what you thought about them.  For me, I have sort of like/dislike  attitude towards The Twilight Zone.  My wife and I watched one years ago, and it intrigued us, so we started watching them regularly for a while.  I have to say, some of them were thought provoking, and some had that cool sci-fi wow factor, however, there were a fair amount that were either too depressing, or would weird me out.  I know the point of them is not to feel good watching them, but many were not for me.  I might watch some select episodes you guys talked about though.   \n-I thought it was cool that they first one my wife and I saw together was the one about the poor apocalyptic guy and his love of books.  -I also remember seeing the one where the astronauts thought they crashed on another planet, but were really on earth.  I really liked that one as a dark commentary on human nature.","html":"","parentHex":"root","score":0,"state":"approved","creationDate":"2018-11-23T19:45:08Z","direction":0,"deleted":false},{"commentHex":"cfe37aa6e528931044e4e1f23283d25e468acbb88b460868930e2fc2ac554acf","domain":"tto.koser.us","url":"/episodes/086-earworms","commenterHex":"6c1bd0b526e8868f38492605a30d07abc976228bb36db664a7d61305c0f142e9","markdown":"This is a good list of true earworms for sure - many of which have plagued my brain.

I think my personal favorite villains are ones that have a strong personal connection to the main character (i.e. a relative or a friend that's gone down the wrong path). Two of my favorites are actually from anime (and I am by no means a diehard anime fan): Raoh from Fist of the North Star ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoh)) and Dio Brando from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dio_Brando)). I also love the Terminator. An unstoppable killer robot that's almost like a slasher villain is pretty epic in my book. Wholeheartedly agree with Mark Hamil's Joker, he's the best.

I think my personal favorite villains are ones that have a strong personal connection to the main character (i.e. a relative or a friend that's gone down the wrong path). Two of my favorites are actually from anime (and I am by no means a diehard anime fan): Raoh from Fist of the North Star ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoh)) and Dio Brando from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dio_Brando)). I also love the Terminator. An unstoppable killer robot that's almost like a slasher villain is pretty epic in my book. Wholeheartedly agree with Mark Hamil's Joker, he's the best.

(Even though I think it was last year I saw it. Eh, better late than never.)\n\nSpoilers I guess for Avatar.\n\nI think overall it's a great show. Loved most of the characters, and a lot of them had meaningful progression. \nUncle Iroh is right up there with my other favorite paragon/mentor characters. (Gandalf, Brom from the Inheritance Cycle, Yoda etc.) It was basically impossible for me to NOT enjoy any moment that included him.\nThe world is built nicely, and the voice acting is spectacular.\nHowever, a few things hold it back from being among my list's very top. It contains some pretty bad episodes (looking at you terrible gorge one \u003e_\u003e) but every show has at least a few of those. Book 3 was maybe my biggest issue. It had way too much filler for me in the season that was supposed to cap everything off. It lacked Iroh almost completely (I know his voice actor died), and the final battle kinda disappointed me. I mean, you build up to a single fight for... How long was it? I can't remember the amount of episodes, but it was a good number. All to end it with green magic powers from a deus ex machina island turtle. I realized a pattern in struggles to end a season well. I disagreed with the choice to make Zuko battle Zhao again rather than Uncle Iroh. We had already seen the fire bending youth defeat the admiral. However we didn't get to see Iroh fulfill his promise of retribution.\nDespite all that and more, it's just really, really good. (Especially Book 2 it has some of the best episodes in any show ever. [Tales of Ba Sing Se; The Cave of Two Lovers or whatever the nomad episode is called] That book is the greatest.)\n\nTl, dr: Has problems but is still very enjoyable. Probably #5 on my list behind Spongebob.","html":"","parentHex":"root","score":0,"state":"approved","creationDate":"2020-08-16T04:52:52.056823Z","direction":0,"deleted":false},{"commentHex":"34b545fed34769175d2d3d25b3f31e52de872ac23e7160f5589d1b33fd7fbcce","domain":"tto.koser.us","url":"/episodes/131-cereals-revisited/","commenterHex":"0fee5c5ba06fdcce36ced25b7a177988b390159b7f7861ab90015d005a58831b","markdown":"Will post additional thoughts after actually listening to the episode :P\nBut here is my top (insert number here) cereals in no particular order.
